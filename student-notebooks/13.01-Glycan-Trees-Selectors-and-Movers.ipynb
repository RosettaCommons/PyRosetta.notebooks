At the deep part of Rosetta, even sugars are denoted as having a 'mainchain'.  This mainchain is the 'non-branched' connections.  In this case, the mainchain continues onto residue 803, while the 'branch' goes off to residue 804.  This is __EXTREMELY__ important to be aware of as MoveMaps have seperate switches for 'branched' torsions.

    "\n",
    "Keywords: RosettaScripts, script, xml, XMLObjects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "RosettaScripts in another way to script custom modules in PyRosetta.  It is much simpler than PyRosetta, but can be extremely powerful, and with great documentation. There are also many publications that give `RosettaScript` examples, or whole protocols as a `RosettaScript` instead of a mover or application. In addition, some early Rosetta code was written with `RosettaScripts` in mind, and still may only be fully accessible via `RosettaScripts` in order to change important variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent versions of Rosetta have enabled full RosettaScript protocols to be run in PyRosetta. A new class called `XMLObjects`, has also enabled the setup of specific rosetta class types in PyRosetta instead of constructing them from code. This tutorial will introduce how to use this integration to get the most out of Rosetta.  Note that some tutorials use RosettaScripts almost exclusively, such as the parametric protein design notebook, as it is simpler to use RS than setting up everything manually in code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RosettaScripts\n",
    "\n",
    "A RosettaScript is made up of different sections where different types of Rosetta classes are constructed. You will see many of these types throughout the notebooks to come. Briefly:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ScoreFunctions`:  A scorefunction evaluates the energy of a pose through physical and statistal energy terms\n",
    "`ResidueSelectors`: These select a list of residues in a pose according to some criteria\n",
    "`Movers`:  These do things to a pose. They all have an `apply()` method that you will see shortly.\n",
    "`TaskOperations`:  These control side-chain packing and design\n",
    "`SimpleMetrics`: The return some metric value of a pose.  This value can be a real number, string, or a composite of values. \n",

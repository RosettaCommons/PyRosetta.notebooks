The code you will be using from Rosetta was written by Vikram Mulligan.  The BundleGridSampler and MakeBundle movers are available through code in PyRosetta, but because of the many number of options to it, it is a bit easier to work with these in XML. We will use this opportunity to do see how easy it is to run XML in PyRosetta, but we will cover the code-level interface as well in this workshop.  \n",

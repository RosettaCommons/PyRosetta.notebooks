    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "__RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD)__ is a generalized framework for the design of antibodies, in which a user can easily tailor the run to their project needs.  __The algorithm is meant to sample the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody-antigen complex.__  An app is available, and all components can be used within RosettaScripts for easy scripting of antibody design and incorporation into other Rosetta protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is based on rigorous bioinformatic analysis and rooted very much on our [recent clustering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21035459) of antibody CDR regions.  It uses the __North/Dunbrack CDR definition__ as outlined in the North/Dunbrack clustering paper. A new clustering paper will be out in the next year, and this new analysis will be incorporated into RAbD. \n",
    "\n",
    "The supplemental methods section of the published paper has all details of the RosettaAntibodyDesign method.  This manual serves to get you started running RAbD in typical use fashions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm\n",
    "  \n",
    "Broadly, the RAbD protocol consists of alternating outer and inner Monte Carlo cycles. Each outer cycle consists of randomly choosing a CDR (L1, L2, etc.) from those CDRs set to design, randomly choosing a cluster and then a structure from that cluster from the database according to the input instructions, and optionally grafting that CDR's structure onto the antibody framework in place of the existing CDR (__GraftDesign__). The program then performs N rounds of the inner cycle, consisting of sequence design (__SeqDesign__) using cluster-based sequence profiles and structural constraints, energy minimization, and optional docking. Each inner cycle structurally optimizes the backbone and repacks side chains of the CDR chosen in the outer cycle as well as optional neighbors in order to optimize interactions of the CDR with the antigen and other CDRs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Backbone dihedral angle (CircularHarmonic) constraints__ derived from the cluster data are applied to each CDR to limit deleterious structural perturbations. Amino acid changes are typically sampled from __profiles derived for each CDR cluster in PyIgClassify__. Conservative amino acid substitutions (according to the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix) may be performed when too few sequences are available to produce a profile (e.g., for H3). After each inner cycle is completed, the new sequence and structure are accepted according to the Metropolis Monte Carlo criterion. After N rounds within the inner cycle, the program returns to the outer cycle, at which point the energy of the resulting design is compared to the previous design in the outer cycle. The new design is accepted or rejected according to the Monte Carlo criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If optimizing the antibody-antigen orientation during the design (dock), SiteConstraints are automatically used to keep the CDRs (paratope) facing the antigen surface.  These are termed __ParatopeSiteConstraints__.   Optionally, one can enable constraints that keep the paratope of the antibody around a target epitope (antigen binding site).  These are called __ParatopeEpitopeSiteConstraints__ as the constraints are between the paratope and the epitope. The epitope is automatically determined as the interface residues around the paratope on input into the program, however, any residue(s) can be set as the epitope to limit unwanted movement and sampling of the antibody.  See the examples and options below. \n",
    "\n",
    "More detail on the algorithm can be found in the published paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Setup and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Antibody Design Database\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis app requires the Rosetta Antibody Design Database.  A database of antibodies from the original North Clustering paper is included in Rosetta and is used as the default .  An updated database (which is currently updated bi-yearly) can be downloaded here: <http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/PyIgClassify/>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor C++, It should be placed in `Rosetta/main/database/sampling/antibodies/`. For PyRosetta, use the cmd-line option `antibody_database` and set it to the full path of the downloaded database within the `init()` function as you have done in the past. It is recommended to use this up-to-date database for production runs. For this tutorial, we will use the database within Rosetta. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Starting Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe protocol begins with the three-dimensional structure of an antibody-antigen complex. Designs should start with an antibody bound to a target antigen (however optimizing just the antibody without the complex is also possible).  Camelid antibodies are fully supported.  This structure may be an experimental structure of an existing antibody in complex with its antigen, a predicted structure of an existing antibody docked computationally to its antigen, or even the best scoring result of low-resolution docking a large number of unrelated antibodies to a desired epitope on the structure of a target antigen as a prelude to de novo design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe program CAN computationally design an antibody to anywhere on the target protein, but it is recommended to place the antibody at the target epitope.  It is beyond the scope of this program to determine potential epitopes for binding, however servers and programs exist to predict these. Automatic SiteConstraints can be used to further limit the design to target regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Model Numbering and Light Chain identification\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe input PDB file must be renumbered to the AHo Scheme and the light chain gene must be identified.  This can be done through the [PyIgClassify Server](http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/pyigclassify/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\tOn input into the program, Rosetta assigns our CDR clusters using the same methodology as PyIgClassify. The RosettaAntibodyDesign protocol is then driven by a set of command-line options and a set of design instructions provided as an input file that controls which CDR(s) are designed and how. Details and example command lines and instruction files are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe gene of the light chain should always be set on the command-line using the option `-light_chain`, these are either lamda or kappa.  PyIgClassify will identify the gene of the light chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor this tutorial, the starting antibody is renumbered for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Notes for Tutorial Shortening\n",
    "\n",
    "\tAlways set the option, `-outer_cycle_rounds` to 5 in order to run these examples quickly.  The default is 25.  We include this in our common options file that is read in by Rosetta at the start. We will only be outputting a single structure, but typical use of the protocol is with default settings of `-outer_cycle_rounds` and an `nstruct` of at least 1000, with 5000-10000 recommended for jobs that are doing a lot of grafting.  For De-novo design runs, one would want to go even higher. Note that the Docking stage increases runtime significantly as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe total number of rounds is outer_cycle_rounds * nstruct.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\tWe will be using JSON output of the scorefile, as this is much easier to work with in python and pandas.\n",
    "\tWe use the option `-scorefile_format json`\n",
    "\n",
    "\tAll of our common options for the tutorial are in the common file that you will copy to your working directory. \n",

    "You are starting design on a new antibody that is not bound to the antigen in the crystal. This is difficult and risky, but we review how one could go about this anyway.  We start by selecting a framework.  Here, we use the trastuzumab framework as it expresses well, is thermodynamically stable with a Tm of 69.5 degrees, and has been shown repeatedly that it can tolerate CDRs of different sequence and structure.  Note that the energy of the complex is high as we are starting from a manual placement of the antibody to antigen.  If we relax the structure too much, we will fall into an energy well that is hard to escape without significant sampling. \n",

Note that denovo design currently takes a large amount of processing power. Each tutorial below is more complex than the one before it.  The examples we have for this tutorial are short runs to show HOW it can be done, but more outer_cycle_rounds and nstruct would produce far better models than the ones you will see here - as we will need to sample the relative orientation of the antibody-antigen complex through docking, the CDR clusters and lengths, the internal backbone degrees of freedom of the CDRs, as well as the sequence of the CDRs and possibly the framework.  As you can tell, just the sampling problem alone is difficult. However, this will give you a basis for using RAbD on your own. \n"

This can be useful for humanizing potential antibodies or framework switching, where we want the binding properties of certain CDRs, but the stability or immunological profile of a different framework.  \n",

It first limits packing and design to only the CDRs and its neighbors.  By specifying the `design_framework=1` option we allow the neighbor framework residues to design, while the CDRs and antigen neighbors will only repack.  If we wanted to disable antigen repacking, we would pass the _DisableAntibodyRegionOperation_ task operation.

Note that we will also design the interface of the antigen using the `-design_antigen` option.  This can be useful for vaccine design. Note that these design options are cmd-line ony options currently (but will be available in a later version of Rosetta). Approx 900 second runtime.\n",

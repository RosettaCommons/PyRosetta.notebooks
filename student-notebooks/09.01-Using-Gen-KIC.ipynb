    "# Introduction to Kinematic Closure (KIC)\n",
    "Kinematic closure algorithms were originally developed for the robotics field to solve the problem of determining the necessary joint angles that would place a robot's hand or foot in a desired place. We have adapted them for use within the Rosetta software suite to sample conformations of chains of atoms with well-defined start and end points.\n",
    "\n",
    "A molecular kinematic closure problem may be described as follows: given a covalently-contiguous chain of atoms within a molecule, with covalent linkages at the ends of the chain fixing the start and end of the chain, what possible conformations maintain the integrity of bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle restrictions within the chain? To solve such a problem, we divide the chain of atoms into two segments, and define \"pivot points\" at the start of the chain (the first pivot), the end of the chain (the last pivot), and the breakpoint between the two segments (the middle pivot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done this, the degrees of freedom within the two segments may be held fixed, randomized, perturbed, or otherwise altered as one sees fit. These degrees of freedom include bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles. Whatever one does to these degrees of freedom, one ends up with two segments that still have well-defined rigid body transforms from the first pivot to the middle pivot (in the first segment), and from the middle pivot to the last pivot (in the second segment). It is then possible to solve a system of equations for the six torsion angles adjacent to the three pivots in order to keep the system closed. The matrix math that gives rise to the solution(s) is extremely fast as compared to alternative loop closure methods (which typically rely on iterative gradient-descent minimization); however, for a given system, this step may yield anywhere from 0 to 16 solutions. It then becomes necessary to choose a solution for downstream molecular design or conformational refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GeneralizedKIC mover in Rosetta gives a user full control over pre-closure sampling, post-closure filtering, and selection of a closure solution. It also allows closure of chains that do not consist solely of polypeptide backbones: that is, it is fully compatible with closure of atomic chains that run through disulfide bonds, arbitrary side-chain cross-links or cross-linkers, and non-canonical backbones.\n",
    "\n",
    "GenKic is **Extremely** flexible. It can deifine entire topologies<sup>1,2</sup> or rebuild small loops. Accordingly, we are defining lots of functions to show you how you would configure PyRosetta to accomplish a general GenKic task. \n",

    "# Exercise: Building and Closing a Polypeptide Loop Using PyRosetta\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will be using an NMR structure of an artificial mini-protein designed by Dr. Chris Bahl (PDB ID 2ND2). This mini-protein is a 44-residue 3-helix bundle. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will define two poses. One complete structure, and one structure has been stripped of its amino acid sequence (i.e. it has been mutated to poly-glycine), and the loop connecting the second and third helices has been deleted. This is meant to simulate many common design cases, in which one might arrange secondary structure elements first and build loops later (e.g. in the case of parametric design approaches), as well as certain structure prediction cases, in which one might wish to model loops that are missing in crystal structures. We will rebuild this loop and sample its possible conformations."

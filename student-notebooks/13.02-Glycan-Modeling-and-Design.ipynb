    "Keywords: carbohydrate, glycan, glucose, mannose, sugar, design, prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Here, you will learn how to model glycans and design optimal glycosylation positions in a protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the RosettaCarbohydrate framework to build and model glycans.  The `GlycanModeler`, which is our main method for modeling glycans, will be published in 2020.  We will be using some custom glycan options to load pdbs. \n",
    "First, one needs the `-include_sugars` option, which will tell Rosetta to load sugars and add the sugar_bb energy term to a default scorefunction.  This scoreterm is like rama for the sugar dihedrals which connect each sugar residue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t-include_sugars\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When loading structures from the PDB that include glycans, we use these options. This includes an option to write out the structures in pdb format instead of the Rosetta format (which is actually better).  Again, this is included in the config/flags files you will be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\t-maintain_links\n",
    "\t\t-auto_detect_glycan_connections\n",
    "\t\t-alternate_3_letter_codes pdb_sugar\n",
    "\t\t-write_glycan_pdb_codes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on working with glycans can be found at this page: [Working With Glycans](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/carbohydrates/WorkingWithGlycans)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "  \n",
    "The `GlycanModeler` essentially builds glycans from the root (The first residue of the Tree) out to the trees in a way that simulates a tree growing.  It uses a notion of a 'layer' where the layer is defined as the number of residues to the glycan root (with the glycan root being layer 0).  Within modeling, all glycan residues other than the ones being optimized are 'virtualized'.  In Rosetta, the term 'Virtual' means that these residues are present, but not scored.  (It should be noted that it is now possible to turn any residues Virtual and back to Real using two movers: `ConvertVirtualToRealMover` and `ConvertRealToVirtualMover`. )\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the modeling application, sampling of glycan DOFs is done through the `GlycanSampler`.  The sampler attempts to sample the large amount of DOFs available to a glycan tree.  The GlycanSampler is a `WeightedRandomSampler`, which is a container of highly specific sampling strategies, where each strategy is weighted by a particular probability.  At each apply, the mover selects one of these samplers using the probability set to it. This is the same way the SnugDock algorithm for antibody modeling works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is always scaled with the number of glycan residues that you are modeling, so run-time will increase proportionally as well. \n",
    "If you are modeling a huge viral particle with lots of glycans, one can use quench mode, which will optimize each glycan individually. \n",
    "Tpyically for these cases, multiple rounds of glycan modeling is desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### GlycanSampler Major components\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these components were covered in the previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Glycan Conformers__\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThese conformers have been generated through an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the PDB using adaptive kernal density estimates and are unique for each linkage type including glycan residues connected to ASN residues.  A conformer is a specific conformation of all of the backbone dihedrals of a particular glycan linkage. Essentialy glycan 'fragments' for a particular type of linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __SugarBB Sampling__ \n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis sampling is done through turning the `sugar_bb` energy term into a set of probabilities using the -log(e) function.  This allows us to sample on the QM derived torsonal potentials during modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Random Sampling and Shear Moves__\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWe sample random torsions at +/- 15 , +/- 45, +/- 90 degrees, each at decreasing probabilities at a 4:2:1 ratio of sampling Small,Medium,Large. \n",
    "\tShear sampling is done where torsions are set for two residues in order to reduce downsteam effects and allow 'flipping' of the glycan torsions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Minimization__\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tWe Minimize Sugar residues by randomly selecting a residue from what is set to model, and selecting all residues out to the tree that are not virtualized. This reduces computational time that would otherwise restrict the total number of glycan residues we could model at once.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Packing__\n",
    "\n",
    "\tOf the residues set to optimize, we chooses a random residue and pack that residue and all residues out to the tree that are not virtualized. We pack the sugar residues (OH and constituents) and any neighboring protein sidechains. TaskOperations may be set to allow design of protein residues during this.  We do packing this way to once again reduce total computational time.\n",

You may increase glycan_sampler_rounds to 100 and then decrease output to 1-2500 nstruct in order to have the same level of sampling, which will result in very good models as well.  Since this is denovo modeling of glycans, more nstruct is almost always better. For some tutorials, we may decrease this value below our optimal value in order to shorten the length of the tutorial.\n",

    "Here, we will start with the antigen known as Bee Hyaluronidase, from PDB ID 2J88.  The PDB file has an antibody bound to it as a HIGHLY immunogenic site. We would like to block this in order to begin to use this enzyme for therapy as Hyaluronidase can be effective in breaking down sugars in the extracellular matrix, allowing certain larger drugs to get to regions of interest.  The antibody is renumbered into the AHo numbering scheme that we used in the RAbD tutorial, and it has been relaxed with constraints into the Rosetta energy function. \n",

    "A sugar glycosylation site is known as a `Sequon`.  The glycan sequon is made up of three protein residues which are recognized by the GlycosylTransferase Enzyme during translation in the ER.  This enzyme adds the root of nascent glycan onto a protein.  In this case, we use the sequon for ASN glycosylation.  The sequon is as follows: `N[^P][S/T]`.  The `[^P]` notation means that any residue other than P can be there.  The `[S/T]` notation means that either S or T is recognized.  This notation can be used to directly create Motifs in proteins using the `CreateSequenceMotifMover` and associated `SequenceMotifTaskOperation`. Documentation for these is available here:\n",

    "Where do you think the optimal glycan position would be for this particular antibody?  Take a look at the xml.  Is this the position we are targeting?  Typically, we may want to allow some backbone movement in our sequon.  The full glycan scanning protocol can be found in an input file, simple_glycan_scanner_manual.xml, where we relax the motif residues with constraints, add the sequon, and then relax again, comparing the energy between them to get the full energetic contributions of the sequon on the structure.  In order to reduce the run time in these tutorials, we will be removing this going forward.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a structure may be solved with high resolution, not all solved residues may fit the density well.  A structure from the PDB is still a model afterall, informed through experimentation.  This is especially true of glycan residues, which are fairly mobile.  Crystal contacts of neighboring proteins help to reduce the movemment of glycans and may help to induce a state that can be solved more easily given high-resolution density.  In this tutorial, we will be using Rosetta to determine how well a residue fits into the given density.  There are methods to do this in the coot program, but we want to be able to do this for any structure in a streamlined way - especially if we need to calculate RMSDs on only well-fitting glycan residues.  The methods we will be employing in Rosetta are based on Frank Dimaio's work with Rosetta density.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will once again be employing the SimpleMetric system.  In this case, we use the `PerResidueDensityFitMetric`, which is a PerResidueRealMetric.  This type of SimpleMetric calculates a particular value for each residue given a residue selector.  Very useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be employing the DensityFitResidueSelector, which uses the metric.  Since this is a fairly slow metric, we will use in-built functionality for using our calculated values from the metric, which are stored in the pose.  We will then use the SelectedResidueCountMetric to determine how many residues have great fit.  In later tutorials, we will be using the RMSDMetric with this selector in order to calculate RMSD on well-fitting glycan residues. \n",

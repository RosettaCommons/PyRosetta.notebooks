    "Loop modeling is an important step in building homology models, designing enzymes, or docking with flexible loops. The goal of loop modeling is to predict the conformation of a short stretch of protein backbone and sidechains. Loop modeling can be used to predict structures of regions with missing density in crystal structures. Additionally, homology models often need to account for short insertions or deletions, and loop modeling can be used to predict how these sequence changes affect structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different methods for loop modeling, but the basic algorithm goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs are a protein structure and a set of indices specifying where one or more regions to model (i.e. the loop or loops) start and stop. In this notebook, you'll learn how to manually set up a loop FoldTree, which will allow you to specify the regions you want to model. However, in practice, you will not need to make the FoldTree from scratch, and you will see examples of how to do this as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initial build**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by building an initial backbone for each loop being sampled. This backbone is just a starting point for the rest of the algorithm, so it's only realistic in the sense of having reasonable bond lengths and not completely clashing with anything. Note that by skipping this step, you can use the loop modeling algorithm to generate ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Centroid refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm continues by refining the loop conformation in the context of the centroid score function. The centroid score function represents the backbone atoms in full detail, but abstracts the sidechains into spherical blobs. This creates a smoother energy landscape that is easier to explore broadly. The landscape is sampled using Monte Carlo \"local backbone moves\", i.e. moves that perturb the backbone within the region being sampled but not outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Full-atom refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm finishes by refining the loop conformation in the context of the fullatom score function. This is conceptually very similar to the centroid refinement discussed above, except now all the atoms are represented in full detail and both sidechain and local backbone Monte Carlo moves are employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, to predict a structure for a single loop, you would generate at least 500 such models and take whichever has the lowest energy. You might also calculate an RMSD for each model relative to the lowest scoring one and look for funnels in score vs. RMSD space.\n",

    "Because we typically want to isolate the conformational changes to just our target loop region, we need a way to prevent lever-arm effects and control the movements of residues with respect to each other. This is accomplished—as was the case with protein-protein docking—with a fold tree, which is a graph that dictates the propagation of conformational changes throughout the Pose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fold tree stores connections in between residues as \"jump edges\" and \"protein edges.\" Because Rosetta uses internal coordinates rather than Cartesian coordinates, the entire structure that you're working with has to be connected. Protein edges simply describe the connectivity of a covalently-linked peptide chain by stating the starting and ending residues. On the other hand, jump edges are the \"imaginary links\" that describe noncovalent connections, such as those between separate chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "One consequence of using a fold tree is that you can tell Rosetta which residues are upstream and which are downstream. This is important because it will determine the direction in which changes propagate.\n",

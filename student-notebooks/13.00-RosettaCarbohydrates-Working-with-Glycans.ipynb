    "## Backbone Torsions, Residue Connections, and side-chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A glycan tree is made up of many sugar residues, each residue a ring.  The 'backbone' of a glycan is the connection between one residue and another. The chemical makeup of each sugar residue in this 'linkage' effects the propensity/energy of each bacbone dihedral angle.  In addition, sugars can be attached via different carbons of the parent glycan.  In this way, the chemical makeup and the attachment position effects the dihedral propensities. Typically, there are two backbone dihedral angles, but this could be up to 4+ angles depending on the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In IUPAC, the dihedrals of N are defined as the dihedrals between N and N-1 (IE - the parent linkage). The ASN (or other glycosylated protein residue's) dihedrals become part of the first glycan residue that is connected. For this first first glycan residue that is connected to an ASN, it has 4 torsions, while the ASN now has none!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are creating a movemap for dihedral residues, please use the `MoveMapFactory` as this has the IUPAC nomenclature of glycan residues built in in order to allow proper DOF sampling of the backbone residues, especially for branching glycan trees.  In general, all of our samplers should use residue selectors and use the MoveMapFactory to build movemaps internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sugar's side-chains are the constitutents of the glycan ring, which are typically an OH group or an acetyl group.  These are sampled together at 60 degree angles by default during packing.  A higher granularity of rotamers cannot currently be handled in Rosetta, but 60 degrees seems adequete for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Rosetta, glycan connectivity information is stored in the `GlycanTreeSet`, which is continually updated to reflect any residue changes or additions to the pose. \n",

Do you recall how there are two distinct chair conformations that can interconvert between each other? The names for these specific conformations are <sup>4</sup>C<sub>1</sub> and <sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>. The nomenclature is as follows: Superscripts to the left of the capital letter are above the plane of the ring if it is oriented such that its carbon atoms proceed in a clockwise direction when viewed from above. Subscripts to the right of the letter are below the plane of the ring. The letter itself is an abbreviation, where, for example, C indicates a chair conformation and B a boat conformation. In all, there are 38 different ideal ring conformations that any six-membered cycle can take.</p><p>`C-P parameters` refers to the Cremer&ndash;Pople parameters for this conformation (Cremer D, Pople JA.

Then, we can et the conformation for our residue through `Pose`.

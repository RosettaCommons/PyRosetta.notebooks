    "Note: the `aa_repeat` scoreterm works out-of-the-box, and does not need to be applied to the pose to work, it just needs to have a weight of >0 in the scorefunction used by the packer. It imposes a penalty for each stretch of repeating amino acids, with the penalty value depending nonlinearly on the length of the repeating stretch. By default, 1- or 2-residue stretches incur no penalty, 3-residue stretches incur a penalty of +1, 4-residue stretches incur a penalty of +10, and 5-residue stretches or longer incur a penalty of +100. Since the term is sequence-based, it is really only useful for design -- that is, it will impose an identical penalty for a fixed-sequence pose, regardless its conformation. This also means that the term has no conformational derivatives: the minimizer ignores it completely. The term is not pairwise-decomposible, but has been made packer-compatible, so it can direct the sequence composition during a packer run.

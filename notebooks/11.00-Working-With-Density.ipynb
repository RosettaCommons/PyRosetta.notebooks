    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Density can be a useful tool in Rosetta and can be used to refine a PDB structure, test Rosetta structure prediction methods, and build de-novo models guided by density of different resolutions. It can also be used as an experimentally-determined guide/constraint for custom methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rosetta understands X-ray or electron density through scoring.  In this tutorial, we will first walk through how to create a density file that Rosetta understands, and then load it, score it, and refine a structure using it. We will also cover some common tools used while working with density. \n",
    "\n",
    "More complicated protocols exist through the use of `RosettaScripts` in PyRosetta, and even more protocols through applications built using main Rosetta.  We will not cover these in this introductory tutorial, but please refer to the original references listed below (such as De novo protein structure determination...) for how to run these applications.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that symmetry and density can be used together!\n",

    "## Setup for Density Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will make a scorefunction and set `fast_elec_dens` to a proper value and use the `LoadDensityMapMover` to actually load the density map.  Note that (currently) the density map is GLOBAL data within Rosetta - so only a single structure can be modeled/refined at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From the docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several scoring functions have been added to Rosetta which describe how well a structure agrees to experimental density data. Density map data is read in CCP4/MRC format (the density has to minimally cover the asymmetric unit).  The various scoring functions trade off speed versus accuracy, and their use should be primarily determined by the resolution of the density map data:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **elec\\_dens\\_fast** is recommended for most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a slower but more precise scoring function is available.  This is only recommended if **elec\\_dens\\_fast** performs poorly (for example, if map quality varies significantly throughout the map):\n",
    "-   **elec\\_dens\\_window** - Uses the sum of correlations of a sliding window of residues versus the experimental data; structure density only uses all heavy atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights to use vary depending on resolution of data but the following give reasonable ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **elec\\_dens\\_fast**: ~25 is generally good, higher for high-resolution (<3Å) and lower for low-resolution (>6Å)\n",

    "Sometimes in Rosetta we want to run implicit multistage design. That is, we want to optimize one conformation while implicitly modeling another (either negatively or positively). There are many ways to accomplish this depending on your interests. In this section we will look at HBNet, a tool for explicitly designing hydrogen bond networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One negative-design approach is to implicitly model binding specificity. Designing a complicated network of hydrogen bonds at one interface will implicitly destabilize other interfaces. Hydrogen bonds are so sensitive to geometry that competing interfaces are unlikely to be able to \"satisfy\" the network well enough to remain competetive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example can also be viewed through the implicit positive-design lens as well. We often find that Rosetta designs very hydrophobic interfaces (especially with newer score functions). Running HBNet before the traditional design protocols can boost the polar residue concentration of your interface in exchange for a small cost packing quality. In other words, we can implicitly stabilize the unbound state by running HBNet, but it might mildly destabilize the bound state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experience shows that it is useful to run both with and without HBNet, depending on your design case. It is possible that the default design protocol handles your implicits states well enough. When that fails, though, there is not much to do to fix it other than to run pre-design protocols like HBNet. An added benefit of HBNet is that it can provide \"seeds\" for packing, which can influence design diversity if nothing else."

Try designing with a few results from `hbnet.get_additional_output()` to get more coverage of the design space. For the commandline users reading this, this functionality can also be accessed via `multistage_rosetta_scripts` or the `MultiplePoseMover` in `rosetta_scripts`.

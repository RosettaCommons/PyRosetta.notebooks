    "# Refinement Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire standard Rosetta refinement protocol, similar to that presented in Bradley, Misura, & Baker 2005, is available as a `Mover`. Note that the protocol can require ~40 minutes for a 100-residue protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sfxn = get_fa_scorefxn()\n",
    "pose = pose_from_pdb(\"1YY8.clean.pdb\")\n",
    "relax = pyrosetta.rosetta.protocols.relax.ClassicRelax()\n",
    "relax.set_scorefxn(sfxn)\n",
    "relax.apply(pose)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this protocol is DEPRECATED and has been for quite some time.  You will want to FastRelax() instead.  It still takes quite a while.  Replace the ClassicRelax() with FastRelax() and run it now. You will see the FastRelax mover used in many tutorials from here on out.  FastRelax with constraints on each atom is useful to get a crystal structure into the Rosetta energy function.  FastRelax can also be used for flexible-backbone design.  These will all be covered in due time.  "

    "2. *Ab initio folding algorithm*. Based on the Monte Carlo energy optimization algorithm from Workshop #4, write a complete program that will fold a protein. A suggested algorithm involves preliminary low-resolution modifications by fragment insertion (first 9-mers, then 3-mers), followed by high-resolution refinement using small, shear, and minimization movers. Output both your low-resolution intermediate structure and the final refined, high-resolution decoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test your code by attempting to fold domain 2 of the RecA protein (the last 60 amino acid residues of PDB ID 2REB). How do your results compare with the crystal structure? (Consider both your low-resolution and high-resolution results.) If your lowest-energy conformation is different than the native structure, explain why this is so in terms of the limitations of the computational approach.\n",

    "   *Bonus*: After using the `PyMOL_Mover` or `PyMOL_Observer` to record the trajectory, export the frames and tie them together to create an animation. Search the Internet for “PyMOL animation” for additional tools and tips. Animated GIF files are probably the best quality; MPEG and QuickTime formats are also popular and widely compatible and uploadable to YouTube."

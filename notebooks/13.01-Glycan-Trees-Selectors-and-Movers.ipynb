    "Here, we will be opening a PDB file with glycans, so we will use `-include_sugars` and a few other options that allow us to read (most) PDB files without issue. It is always a good idea to use the `GlycanInfoMover` to double check that the glycans you are interested in are properly represented by Rosetta.  If they are not, post the issue in the Rosetta forums.\n",

    "### PDB vs Rosetta sugar format\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are few standards in the PDB for how saccharide residues in `.pdb` files should be numbered and named. The Rosetta code — with the appropriate flags initialization flags, such as `-alternate_3_letter_codes pdb_sugar` tries its best to interpret `.pdb` files with sugars, but because of ambiguity and inconsistency, success is in no way ensured.  See http://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/rosetta_basics/preparation/Preparing-PDB-files-for-non-peptide-polymers for more info\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee that one can model the specific saccharide system desired unabiguously, Rosetta uses a slightly modified `.pdb` format for importing carbohydrate residues. The key difference in formats involves the `HETNAM` record of the PDB format. The standard PDB `HETNAM` record line:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```HETNAM     GLC ALPHA-D-GLUCOSE```\n",
    "\n",
    "...means that all `GLC` 3-letter codes in the <em>entire file</em> are α-<font style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">d</font>-glucose, which is insufficient, as this \n",
    "could mean several different α-<font style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">d</font>-glucoses, depending on the ring form and on the main-chain connectivity of the glycan — and \n",
    "many, many more if one includes modified sugars! The modified Rosetta-ready PDB `HETNAM` \n",
    "record line:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "```HETNAM     Glc A   1  ->4)-alpha-D-Glcp```\n",
    "\n",
    "...means that the `GLC` residue <em>specifically at position A1</em> requires the `->4)-alpha-D-Glcp` `ResidueType` or any of its `VariantType`s. (Note also that Rosetta uses sentence case 3-letter-codes for sugars.)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosetta will output and input with this default format. \n",
    "We use `-alternate_3_letter_codes pdb_sugar` to read in the PDB-format sugar and `-write_glycan_pdb_codes` to output the PDB format since we will be working with a structure directly from the PDB.\n",

At the deep part of Rosetta, even sugars are denoted as having a 'mainchain'.  This mainchain is the 'non-branched' connections.  In this case, the mainchain continues onto residue 803, while the 'branch' goes off to residue 804.  This is __EXTREMELY__ important to be aware of as MoveMaps have seperate switches for 'branched' torsions.  In this way, you should always use the `MoveMapFactory` which does all this automatically for creating glycan Movemaps or torsions that are branched will not be turned on!!! "

The linkage is specific for different types of sugars in the i and i+1 spot, as well as the specific the i+1 glcyan is connected to on residue i.

An \"applicable\" residue is limited to 1,4-linked aldopyranoses or 2,5-linked ketopyranoses for which both the anomeric bond and the glycosidic linkage bond are equatorial.\n",

Sometimes, a simple \"ring flip\" could correct this, but the energy barrier to rotate is too high; the small moves of a ShearMover would never flip the ring around."

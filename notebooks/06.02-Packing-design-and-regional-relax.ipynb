Every time the protein is packed for a single round, the TaskFactory will generate what is called the PackerTask.  This object has all of the instructions needed for Rosetta to do packing and design.  Some TaskOperations can respond to environmental changes in the pose, such as neighboring residues and dynamically change at each packing step.  This is one of the reasons we use the TaskFactory machinery to setup packing instead of hacking the PackerTask itself as has been done in some of the earlier tutorials you may see on the web. "

    "  Briefly, a ResidueSelector returns a boolean vector that is the length of the pose. Each boolean is an indication of whether the residue was selected or not.  Because the vector is the same length of the pose, the index is the residue number.  There are many `ResidueSelectors` in rosetta, including ones for `AND` and `OR` operations to combine them.  Note where most of them come from above: `from rosetta.core.select import residue_selector as selections`\n",

Each time we pack, the TaskFactory will be used to generate packing instructions (`PackerTask`) - and subsequently, the neighbors that we are packing will be updated each time to reflect this changing state of the pose."

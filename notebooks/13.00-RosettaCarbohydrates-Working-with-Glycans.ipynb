    "In this chapter, we will focus on a special subset of non-peptide oligo- and polymers — carbohydrates.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling carbohydrates — also known as saccharides, glycans, or simply sugars — comes with some special challenges. For one, most saccharide residues contain a ring as part of their backbone. This ring provides potentially new degrees of freedom when sampling. Additionally, carbohydrate structures are often branched, leading in Rosetta to more complicated `FoldTrees`.\n",

    "This chapter includes a quick overview of carbohydrate nomenclature, structure, and basic interactions within Rosetta.\n"

    "## Backbone Torsions, Residue Connections, and side-chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A glycan tree is made up of many sugar residues, each residue a ring.  The 'backbone' of a glycan is the connection between one residue and another. The chemical makeup of each sugar residue in this 'linkage' effects the propensity/energy of each bacbone dihedral angle.  In addition, sugars can be attached via different carbons of the parent glycan.  In this way, the chemical makeup and the attachment position effects the dihedral propensities. Typically, there are two backbone dihedral angles, but this could be up to 4+ angles depending on the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In IUPAC, the dihedrals of N are defined as the dihedrals between N and N-1 (IE - the parent linkage). The ASN (or other glycosylated protein residue's) dihedrals become part of the first glycan residue that is connected. For this first first glycan residue that is connected to an ASN, it has 4 torsions, while the ASN now has none!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are creating a movemap for dihedral residues, please use the `MoveMapFactory` as this has the IUPAC nomenclature of glycan residues built in in order to allow proper DOF sampling of the backbone residues, especially for branching glycan trees.  In general, all of our samplers should use residue selectors and use the MoveMapFactory to build movemaps internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sugar's side-chains are the constitutents of the glycan ring, which are typically an OH group or an acetyl group.  These are sampled together at 60 degree angles by default during packing.  A higher granularity of rotamers cannot currently be handled in Rosetta, but 60 degrees seems adequete for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Rosetta, glycan connectivity information is stored in the `GlycanTreeSet`, which is continually updated to reflect any residue changes or additions to the pose. \n",
    "This info is always available through the function \n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tpose.glycan_tree_set()\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical information of each glycan residue can be accessed through the CarbohydrateInfo object, which is stored in each ResidueType object: \n",

    "<p>The output above warrants a brief explanation. First, what does `4C1` mean? Most of us likely remember learning about chair and boat conformations in Organic Chemistry. Do you recall how there are two distinct chair conformations that can interconvert between each other? The names for these specific conformations are <sup>4</sup>C<sub>1</sub> and <sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>. The nomenclature is as follows: Superscripts to the left of the capital letter are above the plane of the ring if it is oriented such that its carbon atoms proceed in a clockwise direction when viewed from above. Subscripts to the right of the letter are below the plane of the ring. The letter itself is an abbreviation, where, for example, C indicates a chair conformation and B a boat conformation. In all, there are 38 different ideal ring conformations that any six-membered cycle can take.</p><p>`C-P parameters` refers to the Cremer&ndash;Pople parameters for this conformation (Cremer D, Pople JA. J Am Chem Soc. 1975;97:1354–1358.). C&ndash;P parameters are an alternative coordinate system used to refer to a ring conformation.</p><p>\n",

    "`Pose::set_nu()` does not exist, because it would rip a ring apart. Instead, to change a ring conformation, we need to use the `set_ring_conformer()` method, which takes a `RingConformer` object. Most of the time, you will not need to adjust the ring conformers, but you should be aware of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask a cyclic `ResidueType` for one of its `RingConformerSet`s to give us the `RingConformer` we want. (Each `RingConformerSet` includes the list of possible idealized ring conformers that such a ring can attain as well as information about the most energetically favorable one.) Then, we can et the conformation for our residue through `Pose`. (The arguments for `set_ring_conformer()` are the `Pose`’s sequence position, ring number, and the new conformer, respectively.)</p> \n",
